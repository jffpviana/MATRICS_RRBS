**What is the MATRICS project?**
Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD), including Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) is a paediatric condition characterized by severe aggression and/or persistent defiant behavior. DBD is heterogeneous because type and severity of symptoms, outcome and associated disorders can be very different from one child to another.

Some children/adolescents meeting criteria for DBD have symptoms such as temper tantrums and reactive aggression, some may have poor empathy or pervasive rule-breaking behavior. Our understanding of the neurobiology to subtype aggression is limited.

MATRICS is a multidisciplinary consortium of academic partners and SMEs that focuses on the subtyping of aggression both within DBD and of the broader cross-disorder trait of aggression. MATRICS has assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of preclinical and clinical top researchers, both from academia and SMEs. MATRICS builds on existing fruitful EU collaborations which maximize feasibility and successful output.

**DNA methylation changes associated with aggression in rodent models**
In this branch of the MATRICS project we are trying to identify DNA methylation changes in three brain regions of three distinct rodent models. We used Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to profile DNA methylation and aim to identify CpGs with significantly different levels of this DNA modification between aggressive and non-aggressive animals.


**Repository Description**

This repository contains the scripts used in data analyses in the project mentioned above as well as the source code for a Shiny App to explore the data. Both data analyses and app are in early stages of development.
